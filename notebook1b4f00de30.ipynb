The dataset comprises the consolidated history of tropical storm paths over the past 50 years in the West Pacific, South Pacific, South Indian, and North Indian basins. \n\nThe dataset provides detailed attributes such as storm Name, Date, Time, wind speed, and GPS points for each advisory point. It's important to note that the wind speeds are recorded in knots. We will conduct an introductory Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and plotly.
